// Advanced province buildings are a future replacement for province buildings
// They can hire people, expand and produce services (or, in future, local modifiers)
// They could be owned by government at expense of national budget
// They could produce "free services"
// They have current size which depends on national funding and profitability
// National funding sets size to funding / cost of worker * province weight
// Private funding increases size when operation is profitable and shrinks when it is not
// Currently they are hardcoded as "enums with properties"
// Future work should be directed toward moving their definitions into content files and integration with dcon
