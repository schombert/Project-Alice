## Modding extensions

This document covers modding extensions that have been added to Project Alice in addition to what Victoria 2 provided. We are generally open to adding more modding extensions by request, under the condition that you actually plan to use them. Generally, we are not interested in speculatively adding extensions just because they might be useful.

### Trigger Condition Parsing

In Victoria 2, a trigger condition such as as `prestige = 5` will trigger when the nation's prestige is greater than or equal to 5. If you want to test whether the value is less than 5, you would have to bury it inside a `NOT` scope. And testing for exact equality would be even more complicated. To simplify things, we support replacing the `=` with one of the following tokens: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`. `==` tests for exact equality, `!=` for inequality, and the rest have their ordinary meanings. We also support replacing `=` with `!=` in most situations. For example, `tag != USA` is the same as `NOT = { tag = USA }`.

### New Effects

- `kill_leader = "name of leader"` -- kills a leader (admiral or general) belonging to the nation in scope with the given name. Note that this will only reliably function if you have explicitly created a leader with that name via effect or via definition in the history files.
- `annex_to = null` -- this turns all the provinces owned by the nation in scope into unowned provinces (which defeats the nation, liberates its puppets, etc).
- `secede_province = null` -- turns the province in scope into an unowned province. This is to replace some of the tricks mods did to turn provinces unowned, such as seceding them to nonexistent tags, etc

### New Trigger Conditions

- `test = name_of_scripted_trigger` -- evaluates a scripted trigger (see below)
- `any_country = { ... }` -- tests whether any existent country satisfies the conditions given in `...`. This is essentially just mirroring how the existing `any_country` effect scope works but for trigger conditions.

### Scripted Triggers

We have added the ability to write complicated trigger conditions once and then to use that same condition multiple times inside other trigger conditions. To use these "scripted triggers," you must add a `scripted triggers` directory to your mod (at the top level of your mod, so the path will look like: `...\mod name\scripted triggers`). Place any number of `.txt` files inside this directory, each of which can contain any number of scripted triggers.

Each scripted trigger in such a file should look like:
```
name_of_condition = {
	main_parameter = nation/state/province/pop/rebel/none
	this_parameter = ...
	from_parameter = ...
	
	... contents of the trigger condition go here...
}
```
You should add an entry for `name_of_condition` to your csv file, since it will appear in tool tips when you use the scripted trigger. The three parameter entries define the content that the trigger will be tested upon (you must pick *one* of the possibilities). A scripted trigger can only be used in a context where the various parameters either match or where the parameter of the scripted trigger is `none` (you can think of `none` as matching everything). For example, if the main parameter is `province` then you could only evaluate the scripted trigger when there was a province in scope. The `this_parameter` and `from_parameter` are optional and may be omitted (they default to `none`). You can define more than one scripted trigger with the same name, so long as they have different parameter types. When using a scripted trigger with multiple versions, the one that fits the current parameters will automatically be selected.

To use a scripted trigger simply add `test = name_of_condition` in a trigger wherever you want to evaluate your scripted trigger and it will work as if you had copied its content into that location. I advise you not to use scripted triggers from within other scripted triggers while defining them. You can safely refer to scripted triggers earlier in the same file, but doing so across files will put you at the mercy of the file loading order.

### If/Else

If and Else statments are now provided to avoid code duplication and make your life easier. A `else` with a limit is equivalent to an `else_if` with a limit, and a `else_if` without a limit is equal to a `else` without a limit. In other words, `else` and `else_if` are essentially synonyms, provided for code clarity.

For example:
```
if = { #run if limit is true
  limit = { ... }
  ...
} else_if = { #run only if the limit above is false, and this limit is true
  limit = { ... }
  ...
} else = { #only if both cases are not fullfilled AND the limit is true
  limit = { ... }
  ...
}
```

No limit specified equals to an `always = yes`.

Additionally, the order of execution for `if` and `else`/`else_if` statments allows for nested code:

```
if = {
	limit = { a = yes }
		money = 1
	if = {
		limit = { b = yes }
		money = 50
	} else {
		money = 100
	}
}
```
This is equivalent to:
```
if = {
	limit = { a = yes b = yes }
	money = 1
	money = 50
} else_if {
	limit = { a = yes }
	money = 1
	money = 100
}
```

Additionally, negation of statments are implicit, in other words:
```
if = {
	limit = { test == yes }
} else {
	limit = { test != yes }
}
```

Is implicitly assumed for every `else` after a `if`, this means that an explicit negation (rewriting everything inside a big NOT statment) is not required for `else` statments, as they now logically are tied to all stamtents beforehand being false, and the statment of it's own limit being true.

An issue which might exist due to the volatility of the syntax could be:
```
else_if = {
  limit = { ... }
} if = {
  limit = { ... }
}
```

The behaviour of this statment is that, since there is no preceding `if` before the `else_if`, the `else_if` will be able to run as if it was chained with an `if` that evaluated to false, in the case of it's limit evaluating to true, then it will run its own effect. However, the other `if` statment will run regardless of the previous expression.

As the lexicographical order of the statments are sequential, this is, every `else_if` and `else` must be preceded by an `if` statment, otherwise they will be chained to the nearest *preceding* `if` statment before them for their lexicographical evaluation, otherwise they will act as an `if` in itself if none is present.

```
else_if = {
  limit = { ... }
} else_if = {
  limit = { ... }
}
```
These `else_if` statments are chained together, if the first runs, the second will not, and viceversa. If no preceding `if` exists before them, the first `else_if` takes the role of the `if` statment.

### Abbreviated `.gui` syntax
 
`size = { x = 5 y = 10 }` can be written as `size = { 5 10 }`, as can most places expecting an x and y pair.
Additionally, `maxwidth = 5` and `maxheight = 10` can be written as `maxsize = { 5 10 }`

### Variable effect commands syntax

Usually, we use `change_variable` to "add" to a variable, and `check_variable` to "check" the contents of a variable, this can be confusing for modders, as such we added the following:
```sh
set_variable = {
	which = varname
	value = 100
}
```

Can now be simply written as: `set_variable = { varname 100 }`

Additionally, the following contractions are also supported:

```sh
change_variable = { varname 1000 }
add_variable = { varname 100 } #same as above
sub_variable = { varname 100 } #equivalent to "add_variable = { varname -100 }"
```
