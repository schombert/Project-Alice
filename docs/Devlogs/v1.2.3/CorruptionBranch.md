# Corruption Branch by SneakBug8

## Corruption

## Factions

1) Industry X supports ideology Y and has loyalty equillibrium
2) The State can introduce extra taxes on Industry X that will turn them to opposition
3) The State can reduce taxes on Industry X that will make them pro-Government

Potential types of concessions:
1. Party pays into treasury for a decrease of local taxes
2. Party asks for money in exchange for more effective local bureaucrats

## Autonomy

Show province nationalism on province screen.

While province has nationalism, bureaucrats have -50% to tax collection efficiency. Justification: newly acquired land usually wasn't properly integrated into countries for quite a long time. Take a look at Alsace-Lorraine, for example.

While bureaucrats are members of a rebel faction, they don't collect taxes.
