Upon clicking on the "Download" text, you'll observe there may be 3 files, two of which are source code ZIP files and TARs, for our purpouses, those are probably not useful to you - and if they're, you should see the building guide instead. So, dwnload the one which is NOT the source code.

Drag and drop all of those files into your Victoria 2 directory, it should then look like this

Then simply click on the `launch_alice` executable.

- `Alice`: The main game executable, do not open it directly.
- `launch_alice`: The game launcher, you need to create/recreate scenarios for each change you do to the mods.
- `dbg_alice`: A small debug utility to help track down errors, optional and it's fine if you don't have it.
- `readme OR ELSE.txt`: Contains relevant information, again, optional and it's fine if you don't have it.
- `assets`: Folder NEEDED for Alice to work properly.
