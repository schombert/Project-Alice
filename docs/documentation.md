## Documenation

### Documenation generation

All the docementation is done by markdown files currently. The website is generated by doxygen though, which means that we could use that also if we wanted. For now we just use it to to create the website. We use https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css for the styling with some minor adjustments. The documentation is generated with by the `docs/generate_docs.sh` shell script.

#### How to struture the files
Now for the part that matters,

- The markdown files should be located in `docs/` folder
- The sidebar will have the same format as the file structure
- If a file has the same name as the folder it's in it will be used as the 'start page' for that folder. Otherwise it will just show all the files in the folder
- Neither the folders or the file names can have spaces in them
- The file should start with a markdown header, this will be the title in the sidebar and the page
- The [about.md](about.md) is the start page by default

#### Issues
- The website doesn't work on mobile devices
- We currently can't handle the pngs having the same name even if they are in different folders, this will be fixed if it ever becomes a problem
