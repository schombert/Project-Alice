factory_hired_unqualified;Factory hired ?Y$value$?W ?Yunskilled workers?W to do simple manual tasks. An ?Yunskilled worker?W provides only ?R$x$?W of a ?Ycraftsman?W output.
factory_hired_primary;Factory hired ?Y$value$?W ?Ycraftsmen?W.
factory_hired_secondary;Factory hired ?Y$value$?W ?Ymanagers and engineers?W. They multiply factory output by ?G$x$?W.
factory_throughput_explanation;Throughput is a measure of raw power of a factory. It's measured in ?Gproduction units?W. Throughput drives both consumption of inputs and production of output. The only source of throughput are ?Gemployment units?W generated by ?Yunskilled workers?W and ?Ycraftsmen?W. Technology advancements can increase amount of ?Gproduction units?W generated per worker. Current throughput modifier is ?G$val$?W. Thus, current ?Y$y$?W employment units generate ?Y$x$?W (?G$val$?W of ?Y$y$?W) production units. Essentially, increase of throughput allows capitalists to employ less workers for the same total wage.
factory_throughput_base;In Project Alice factories can access goods only from the local market. It means that in early game some goods are very hard to obtain. To partly compensate for it, there is a ?G$val$?W base multiplier to throughput.
factory_throughput_modifiers;Current technologies and other modifiers provide a throughput multiplier equal to ?G$val$?W
factory_input_multiplier_explanation;Inputs multiplier is the strongest industry-related multiplier as it doesn't suffer from diminishing returns. On the opposite, the more you stack a source of this multiplier, the stronger it becomes. Current multiplier is equal to ?G$val$?W.
factory_input_multiplier_competition;Local competition between capitalists encourages factories to be more efficient and consume only ?G$val$?W of required inputs.
factory_input_multiplier_scale;Smaller factories have to be lean and avoid waste to survive, current factory has ?G$val$?W multiplier due to this reason.
factory_input_multiplier_specialisation;Scientific, political and legal priorities of private and national agents aligned to provide this industry with ?G$val$?W input multiplier.
factory_input_multiplier_modifiers;Various technologies and inventions allow this factory to enjoy additional ?G$val$?W input multiplier.
factory_output_multiplier_explanation;Output multiplier is a strong multiplier but suffers from diminishing returns. Currently this factory has ?G$val$?W output multiplier.
factory_output_multiplier_lack_of_inputs;Due to lack of inputs, output of this factory is multiplied by ?R$val$?W.
factory_output_multiplier_efficiency_inputs;To achieve full output, factory has to consume special efficiency inputs. Currently it suffers ?R$val$?W multiplier due to inability to do so.
factory_output_multiplier_secondary_workers;Employed ?Ymanagers and engineers?W provide factory with ?G$val$?W output multiplier.
factory_output_multiplier_modifiers;Various technologies and inventions provide additional ?G$val$?W multiplier.
